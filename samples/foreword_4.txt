And he was a very dear friend indeed! The calendar says I had known him only for a
few months but there exist friendships which develop their own inner duration, their
own eons of transparent time independent of rotating, malicious music. Never shall I
forget how elated I was upon learning, as mentioned in a note my reader shall find;
that the suburban house into which I moved, stood next to that
of the celebrated American poet whose verses I had tried to put into two
decades earlier! Apart from this glamorous neighborhood, the château,
as I was soon to discover, had little to recommend it. The heating system was a farce,
depending as it did on registers in the floor wherefrom the tepid exhalations of a
throbbing and groaning basement furnace were transmitted to the rooms with the
faintness of a moribund's last breath. By occluding the apertures upstairs I attempted
to give more energy to the register in the living room but its climate proved to be
incurably vitiated by there being nothing between it and the arctic regions save a
sleezy front door without a vestige of vestibule - either because the house had been
built in midsummer by a naïve settler who could not imagine the kind of winter New
Wye had in store for him, or because old-time gentility required that a chance caller at
the open door could satisfy himself from the threshold that nothing unseemly was
going on in the parlor.
