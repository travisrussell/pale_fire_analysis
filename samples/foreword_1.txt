This batch of eighty cards was held by a rubber band which I now religiously put back
after examining for the last time their precious contents. Another, much thinner, set of
a dozen cards, clipped together and enclosed in the same manila envelope as the main
batch, bears some additional couplets running their brief and sometimes smudgy
course among a chaos of first drafts. As a rule, Shade destroyed drafts the moment he
ceased to need them: well do I recall seeing him from my porch, on a brilliant
morning, burning a whole stack of them in the pale fire of the incinerator before
which he stood with bent head like an official mourner among the wind-borne black
butterflies of that backyard auto-da-f√©. But he saved those twelve cards because of the
unused felicities shining among the dross of used draftings. Perhaps, he vaguely
expected to replace certain passages in the Fair Copy with some of the lovely
rejections in his files, or, more probably, a sneaking fondness for this or that vignette,
suppressed out of architectonic considerations, or because it had annoyed Mrs. S.,
urged him to put off its disposal till the time when the marble finality of an
immaculate typescript would have confirmed it or made the most delightful variant 
seem cumbersome and impure. And perhaps, let me add in all modesty, he intended to
ask my advice after reading his poem to me as I know he planned to do.
