Well did I know he could never resist a golden drop of this or that, especially since he
was severely rationed at home. With an inward leap of exultation I relieved him of the
large envelope that hampered his movements as he descended the steps of the porch,
sideways, like a hesitating infant. We crossed the lawn, we crossed the road. 
Clinkclank, came the horseshoe music from Mystery Lodge. In the large envelope I carried
I could feel the hard cornered, rubberbanded batches of index cards. We are absurdly
accustomed to the miracle of a few written signs being able to contain immortal
imagery, involutions of thought, new worlds with live people, speaking, weeping,
laughing. We take it for granted so simply that in a sense, by the very act of brutish
routine acceptance, we undo the work of the ages, the history of the gradual
elaboration of poetical description and construction, from the treeman to Browning,
from the caveman to Keats. What if we awake one day, all of us, and find ourselves
utterly unable to read? I wish you to gasp not only at what you read but at the miracle
of its being readable so I used to tell my students. Although I am capable, through 
long dabbling in blue magic, of imitating any prose in the world but singularly
enough not verse - I am a miserable rhymester, I do not consider myself a true artist,
save in one matter: I can do what only a true artist can do - pounce upon the forgotten
butterfly of revelation, wean myself abruptly from the habit of things, see the web of
the world, and the warp and the weft of that web. Solemnly I weighed in my hand
what I was carrying under my left armpit, and for a moment, I found myself enriched
with an indescribable amazement as if informed that fireflies were making decodable
signals on behalf of stranded spirits, or that a bat was writing a legible tale of torture
in the bruised and branded sky.
