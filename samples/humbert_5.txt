Being a murderer with  a  sensational  but  incomplete  and  unorthodox
memory,  I cannot tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the exact day when I first
knew with utter certainty that the red convertible was following  us.  I  do
remember,  however,  the  first  time  I saw its driver quite clearly. I was
proceeding slowly one afternoon through torrents of  rain  and  kept  seeing
that red ghost swimming and shivering with lust in my mirror, when presently
the  deluge  dwindled to a patter, and then was suspended altogether. With a
swishing sound a sunburst swept the highway,  and  needing  a  pair  of  new
sunglasses,  I  pussled  up  at  a filling station. What was happening was a
sickness, a cancer, that could not be helped, so I simply ignored  the  fact
that  our  quiet pursuer, in his converted state, stopped a little behind us
at a cafe or bar bearing the idiotic sign The Bustle A Deceitful  Seatful.
Having  seen  to  the needs of my car, I walked into the office to get those
glasses and pay for the gas. As I was in the act  of  signing  a  traveler's
check  and wondered about my exact whereabouts, I happened to glance through
a side window, and saw a terrible thing. A broad-backed man, baldish, in  an
oatmeal  coat  and  dark brown trousers, was listening to who was leaning
out of the car and talking to him very  rapidly,  her  hand  with  outspread
fingers  going up and down as it did when she was very serious and emphatic.
What struck me with sickening force was how should I put  it? the  voluble
familiarity  of  her way, as if they had known each other oh, for weeks and
weeks. I saw him scratch his cheek and nod, and turn, and walk back  to  his
convertible, a broad and thickish man of my age, somewhat resembling a  cousin  of my father's same smoothly tanned face,
fuller than mine, with a small dark mustache and a rosebud degenerate mouth.
