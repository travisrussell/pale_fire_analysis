Our close
friendship was on that higher, exclusively intellectual level where one can rest from
emotional troubles, not share them. My admiration for him was for me a sort of alpine
cure. I experienced a grand sense of wonder whenever I looked at him, especially in
the presence of other people, inferior people. This wonder was enhanced by my
awareness of their not feeling what I felt, of their not seeing what I saw, of their
taking Shade for granted, instead of drenching every nerve, so to speak, in the
romance of his presence. Here he is, I would say to myself, that is his head, containing
a brain of a different brand than that of the synthetic jellies preserved in the skulls
around him. He is looking from the terrace (of Prof. C.'s house on that March evening)
at the distant lake. I am looking at him, I am witnessing a unique physiological
phenomenon: perceiving and transforming the world, taking it in and
taking it apart, re-combining its elements in the very process of storing them up so as
to produce at some unspecified date an organic miracle, a fusion of image and music,
a line of verse. And I experienced the same thrill as when in my early boyhood I once
watched across the tea table in my uncle's castle a conjurer who had just given a
fantastic performance and was now quietly consuming a vanilla ice. I stared at his
powdered cheeks, at the magical flower in his buttonhole where it had passed through
a succession of different colors and had now become fixed as a white carnation, and
especially at his marvelous fluid-looking fingers which could if he chose make his
spoon dissolve into a sunbeam by twiddling it, or turn his plate into a dove by tossing
it up in the air.
