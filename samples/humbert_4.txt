There is nothing louder than an American hotel; and, mind you, this was
supposed to be a quiet, cozy, old-fashioned, homey place--"gracious  living"
and  all  that  stuff. The clatter of the elevator's gate--some twenty yards
northeast of my head but as clearly perceived as if it were inside  my  left
temple--alternated  with  the  banging  and booming of the machine's various
evolutions and lasted well beyond midnight. Every now and then,  immediately
east  of my left ear (always assuming I lay on my back, not daring to direct
my viler side toward the nebulous haunch of my bed-mate), the corridor would
brim with cheerful, resonant and inept exclamations ending in  a  volley  of
good-nights.  When  that  stopped,  a  toilet immediately north of my
cerebellum took over. It was a manly, energetic, deep-throated  toilet,  and
it  was  used  many  times. Its gurgle and gush and long afterflow shook the
wall behind me. Then someone in a southern direction was extravagantly sick,
almost coughing out his life with his liquor, and his toilet descended  like
a  veritable  Niagara, immediately beyond our bathroom. And when finally all
the waterfalls had stopped, and the enchanted hunters were sound asleep, the
avenue under the window of my insomnia, to the west  of  my  wake--a  staid,
eminently  residential,  dignified alley of huge trees--degenerated into the
despicable haunt of gigantic trucks roaring through the wet and windy night.
