As to my own activities, they were I am afraid most unsatisfactory from all points of
view - emotional, creative, and social. That jinxy streak had started on the eve when I
had been kind enough to offer a young friend - a candidate for my third ping pong
table who after a sensational series of traffic violations had been deprived of his
driving license - to take him, in my powerful, all the way to his parents'
estate, a little matter of two hundred miles. In the course of an all-night party among
among crowds of strangers - young people, old people, cloyingly perfumed girls - in
an atmosphere of fireworks, barbecue smoke, horseplay, jazz music, and auroral
swimming, I lost all contact with the silly boy, was made to dance, was made to sing,
got involved in the most boring bibble babble imaginable with various relatives of the
child, and finally, in some inconceivable manner, found myself transported to a
different party on a different estate, where, after some indescribable parlor games, in
which my beard was nearly snipped off, I had a fruit and rice breakfast and was taken
by my anonymous host, a drunken old fool in tuxedo and riding breeches, on a
stumbling round of his stables. Upon locating my car off the road, in a pine grove, I
tossed out of the driver's seat a pair of soggy swimming trunks and a girl's silver
slipper. The brakes had aged overnight, and I soon ran out of gas on a desolate stretch
of road. Six o'clock was being chimed by the clocks, when I
reached Arcady, swearing to myself never to be caught like that again and innocently
looking forward to the solace of a quiet evening with my poet. Only when I saw the
beribboned flat carton I had placed on a chair in my hallway did I realize that I had
almost missed his birthday.
