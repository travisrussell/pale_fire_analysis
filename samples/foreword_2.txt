Henceforth I began seeing more and more of my celebrated neighbor. The view from
one of my windows kept providing me with first-rate entertainment, especially when I
was on the wait for some tardy guest. From the second story of my house the Shades'
living-room window remained clearly visible so long as the branches of the deciduous
trees between us were still bare, and almost every evening I could see the poet's
slippered foot gently rocking. One inferred from it that he was sitting with a book in a
low chair but one never managed to glimpse more than that foot and its shadow
moving up and down to the secret rhythm of mental absorption, in the concentrated
lamplight. Always at the same time the brown morocco slipper would drop from the
wool-socked foot which continued to oscillate, with, however, a slight slackening of
pace. One knew that bedtime was closing in with all its terrors; that in a few minutes
the toe would prod and worry the slipper, and then disappear with it from my golden
field of vision traversed by the black bendlet of a branch. And sometimes
would trip by with the velocity and swinging arms of one flouncing out in a fit of
temper, and would return a little later, at a much slower gait, having, as it were,
pardoned her husband for his friendship with an eccentric neighbor; but the riddle of
her behavior was entirely solved one night when by dialing their number and
watching their window at the same time I magically induced her to go through the
hasty and quite innocent motions that had puzzled me.
