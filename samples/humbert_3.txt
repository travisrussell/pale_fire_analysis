No  man can bring about the perfect murder; chance, however, can do it.
There was the famous dispatch of a in Arles, southern France,  at
the  close  of last century. An unidentified bearded six-footer, who, it was
later conjectured, had been the lady's secret lover, walked up to her  in  a
crowded  street,  soon  after  her  marriage, and mortally
stabbed her in the back, three times, while the Colonel, a small bulldog  of
a  man,  hung  onto  the  murderer's  arm.  By  a  miraculous  and beautiful
coincidence, right at the moment  when  the  operator  was  in  the  act  of
loosening  the  angry  little  husband's  jaws (while several onlookers were
closing in upon the group), a cranky Italian in the  house  nearest  to  the
scene  set  off  by  sheer  accident some kind of explosive he was tinkering
with, and immediately the street was turned into  a  pandemonium  of  smoke,
falling bricks and running people. The explosion hurt no one (except that it
knocked out game Colonel); but the lady's vengeful lover ran when the
others ran and lived happily ever after.
     Now  look  what  happens  when  the  operator  himself  plans a perfect
removal.
