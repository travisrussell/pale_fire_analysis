Large wet snowflakes were drifting aslant as I approached an ugly old house, its face half hidden in a mask of scaffolding, I tapped on the glass of the porter's lodge, a muslin curtain was roughly drawn aside, a small window was knocked open and a blowsy old woman gruffly informed me that Frau did live in the house.
