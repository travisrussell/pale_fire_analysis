She seemed also calmer than before; her self control had improved. During the
previous meetings, and throughout their marital life, there had been, on her 
part, dreadful outbursts of temper. When in the first years of marriage he had wished
to cope with those blazes and blasts, trying to make her take a rational view of her
misfortune, he had found them very annoying; but gradually he learned to take
advantage of them and welcomed them as giving him the opportunity of getting rid of
her presence for lengthening periods of time by not calling her back after a sequence
of doors had slammed ever more distantly, or by leaving the palace himself for some
rural hideout.
In the beginning of their calamitous marriage he had strenuously tried to possess her
but to no avail. He informed her he had never made love before which was perfectly
true insofar as the implied object could only mean one thing to her, upon which he
was forced to endure the ridicule of having her dutiful purity involuntarily enact the
ways of a courtesan with a client too young or too old; he said something to that effect
mainly to relieve the ordeal, and she made an atrocious scene. He farced himself
with aphrodisiacs, but the anterior characters of her unfortunate sex kept fatally
putting him off. One night when he tried tiger tea, and hopes rose high, he made the
mistake of begging her to comply with an expedient which she made the mistake of
denouncing as unnatural and disgusting. Finally he told her that an old riding accident
was incapacitating him but that a cruise with his pals and a lot of sea bathing would
be sure to restore his strength.
